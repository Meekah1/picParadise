*PicParadise*


PicParadise is a Decentralized Gallery photo app that allows users to upload and view pictures using blockchain technology. This app is built on the Ethereum blockchain and uses smart contracts to securely manage the uploading and viewing of pictures. NB: PicParadise sole purpose is mainly to allow users have a decentralized Gallery for their Photos

Features
Upload pictures: Users can upload pictures to the app and sell them to other users.
View pictures: Users can browse through pictures uploaded by other users.
How it Works
PicParadise uses the Ethereum blockchain to ensure that transactions are secure and transparent. When a user uploads a picture, a smart contract is created to represent that picture. The smart contract contains all the relevant information about the picture, including its owner address and metadata.

Getting Started
To use PicParadise, you will need an Ethereum wallet that supports the ERC-721 token standard. This is the token standard used by the app's native token, which is used to buy(optional) pictures. You can use popular wallets like MetaMask or MyEtherWallet to interact with the app.

To upload a picture, simply connect to your wallet on the app and follow the instructions to upload your picture. 

Development
PicParadise is an open-source project, and contributions are always welcome! The app is built using React, Hardhat, and Solidity. To get started with development, you will need to clone the repo and install the dependencies:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/Meekah1/picParadise.git

You can then run the app locally using:

# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
