PicParadise
PicParadise is a decentralized photo app that allows users to upload, view, and buy(Optional) pictures using blockchain technology. This app is built on the Ethereum blockchain and uses smart contracts to securely manage the uploading, viewing, buying(optional) and selling(optional) of pictures. NB: PicParadise sole purpose is mainly to allow users have a decentralized storage for their photo(s) without the fear of anyone having access to it and also with buy option

Features
Upload pictures: Users can upload pictures to the app and sell them to other users.
View pictures: Users can browse through pictures uploaded by other users.
Buy pictures(optional): Users can buy pictures using cryptocurrency and the app's native token.
How it Works
PicParadise uses the Ethereum blockchain to ensure that transactions are secure and transparent. When a user uploads a picture, a smart contract is created to represent that picture. The smart contract contains all the relevant information about the picture, including its price, owner, and metadata.

When another user wants to buy(optional) a picture, they send cryptocurrency to the smart contract, and if the payment is successful, ownership of the picture is transferred to the buyer. The smart contract automatically distributes the payment to the seller.

Getting Started
To use PicParadise, you will need an Ethereum wallet that supports the ERC-721 token standard. This is the token standard used by the app's native token, which is used to buy(optional) pictures. You can use popular wallets like MetaMask or MyEtherWallet to interact with the app.

To upload a picture, simply connect to your wallet on the app and follow the instructions to upload your picture. You can set the price for your picture and wait for other users to buy(optional) it.

To buy(optional) a picture, simply browse through the pictures available on the app and select the one you want to buy. You will need to send cryptocurrency to the smart contract representing the picture to complete the transaction.

# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
